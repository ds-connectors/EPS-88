    "Earth is constantly losing heat from its interior. This internal heat has two main sources 1) the formation of Earth and 2) heat produced by the decay of radioactive isotopes. Heat can be transmitted 3 ways 1) conduction 2) convection and 3) radiation. In the system we'll look at today - the flow of heat out of the surface of the earth - the relavent transport mechanism is conduction. The transport of heat by conduction in a solid is governed by a simple equation. Consider a solid bar of length $L$ and cross-sectional area $A$ with its ends maintained at temperatures $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$, respectively (Fig.4.15a). Assuming that heat flows only along the bar (i.e., there are no side losses) the net amount of heat ($\\Delta  Q$) that passes in a given time from the hot end to the cold end depends directly on the temperature difference ($T_{2}-T_{1}$), the area of cross-section ($A$) and the time of observation ($\\Delta  t$), and inversely on the length of the bar ($L$). These observations can be summarized in the equation\n",
