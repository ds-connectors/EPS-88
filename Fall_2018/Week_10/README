Module 4b
- Load peak ground acceleration observations from two notable M6 quakes in California
- Fit a ground motion prediction equation (GMPE) using `polyfit`
- Vary our assumed mean event depth to find better fitting model
- Fit a GMPE after weighing the data by the distance distribution using `linalg.solve`
