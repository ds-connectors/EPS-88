    "\n",
    "In order to use the observations of peak ground acceleration (and other parameters like peak velocity, or spectral acceleration quantities) it is necessary to develop a model that accurately describes the behavior. From physics it is understood that in the far-field (large distance compared to the source dimension) that ground motions decay as a power law with distance due to the spreading of wave energy in three dimensions as the wavefield travels outward from the earthquake source. This is called geometrical spreading. In addition, there is a inelastic attenuation term that accounts for dissipative energy loss due to material imperfections. Based on theory the following is a simple relationship that describes this behavior.\n",

    "$r=\\sqrt{(dist^2 + h^2)}$\n",

    "$r$ is the total distance from the source taking into account an average depth $h$, $a$ is a coeffient that depends on magnitude and scales the overall motions, $b$ is the exponent for the power-law geometrical spreading term, and $c$ is the coefficient for the in-elastic term (important only at large distances). Taking the natural logarithm of this equation yields a linear relationship in the model coeffients.\n",

    "You have probably noticed that the data is not uniformly distributed in distance. In such circumstances it is often advantageous to weight the data prior to inversion to make their respecive influence to the model more equal. In this particular problem it is possible to consider discrete distance bins of 10 km width from 0 to 180 km and count the number of events in each bin. Then the weight can be the inverse of the count, meaning that the weight of bins with many observations will be less and distance bins with fewer will be given more influence with a goal of making the influence on the model more equal over the entire distance range.\n",
